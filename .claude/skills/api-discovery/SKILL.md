# API Discovery & Possibilities

You are an expert at exploring APIs, understanding data shapes, and mapping them to the best possible OpenBB Workspace experience. This skill sits **before** the app-builder — it helps users who look at an API and think "I don't know what I can do with this" or "I don't know which widget type gets the most out of this data."

## Quick Reference

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "Explore this API: {url}" | Full API discovery walkthrough |
| "What can I build with {API name}?" | Possibilities brainstorming |
| "How should I use the PDF widget?" | Widget-specific optimization guide |
| "I'm a {role}, what should I build?" | Persona-driven recommendations |

## Execution Modes

| Mode | Triggers | Behavior |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Explore** | URL, "explore", "discover", "what's available" | Fetch API docs, map all endpoints, categorize data shapes |
| **Possibilities** | "what can I", "possibilities", "ideas", "brainstorm" | Generate widget ideas and dashboard concepts from API |
| **Optimize** | "best widget for", "how to use", "optimal", "get value" | Deep-dive on matching data to the ideal widget type |
| **Persona** | "I'm a", "my role is", "I need to", "use case" | Tailor recommendations to user's role and workflow |

**Mode detection**: Check user's first message for trigger phrases. Combine modes when appropriate (e.g., "Explore this API, I'm a policy researcher" = Explore + Persona).

## Phase 0: Discovery Interview

**Goal**: Build a deep understanding of what the user wants through iterative conversation — NOT a one-shot dump of questions.

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.** Do not skip to reconnaissance. The interview shapes everything that follows.

### How the Interview Works

This is a **multi-round conversation**, not a checklist. Ask 2-3 questions at a time, listen to answers, then ask follow-up questions that go deeper based on what you learned. Continue until you have a clear picture.

### Round 1: Intent & Mental Model

Start by understanding how the user **thinks about** this data:

- "What are you trying to accomplish with this API? What decisions will this dashboard help you make?"
- "When you think about this data, what are the main dimensions you navigate by?" (e.g., time, geography, category, entity)
- "Walk me through a typical workflow — what would you search for first, then drill into?"

### Round 2: Navigation & Ontology (based on Round 1 answers)

Dig into how the information is naturally structured:

- "You mentioned {dimension} — how granular do you need to go? (e.g., year vs month vs day, state vs county vs city)"
- "Are there categories or types that matter to you? What are the key distinctions?"
- "When you're looking at a specific {entity}, what related information do you want to see alongside it?"
- "Do you ever need to cross-reference between {dimension A} and {dimension B}?"

### Round 3: Refinement & Priorities

Confirm understanding and prioritize:

- "So your primary workflow is: {summarize}. Is that right, or am I missing something?"
- "If you could only have 3 filters on a widget, which would be most important?"
- "Are there any edge cases or less-common searches you'd still want to support?"

### Round 4+: Go Deeper If Needed

Keep asking until the user confirms you've captured their vision. Signs you're NOT done:
- User mentions a use case you haven't explored
- You don't understand the ontology well enough to design params
- You haven't discussed how different widgets should relate to each other

**Output**: A clear mental model of:
1. The user's primary workflows and decision-making needs
2. The information ontology — what dimensions, categories, and relationships matter
3. How granular navigation should be along each dimension
4. Which views should link together (e.g., table click → document viewer)

## Phase 1: API Reconnaissance

**Goal**: Understand everything the API offers before making any widget decisions.

### Steps

1. **Fetch documentation** — Use WebFetch on the API docs URL. If docs redirect or are unavailable, try:
   - `{base_url}/docs` (FastAPI/Swagger)
   - `{base_url}/api-docs`
   - `{base_url}/swagger.json` or `{base_url}/openapi.json`
   - WebSearch for `"{API name}" API documentation`

2. **Catalog endpoints** — For each endpoint, record:
   - HTTP method and path
   - Required vs optional parameters
   - Response format (JSON array, object, PDF, XML, HTML)
   - Rate limits or pagination
   - Authentication requirements

3. **Identify data shapes** — Classify each endpoint output:

| Data Shape | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Tabular** | Array of objects with consistent keys | `/documents.json` → list of records |
| **Single Record** | One object with detailed fields | `/documents/{id}.json` → single doc |
| **Time Series** | Records with date/time + values | `/counts_by_date.json` → daily counts |
| **Document/PDF** | Full document content or PDF URL | `/documents/{id}.pdf` → PDF file |
| **Narrative Text** | Long-form text, summaries, analysis | `/documents/{id}/abstract` → text |
| **Hierarchical** | Nested categories, trees, org charts | `/agencies.json` → nested structure |
| **Metric/Scalar** | Single value or small set of KPIs | `/statistics` → counts, averages |
| **Feed/Stream** | Chronological items (news, events) | `/recent_articles` → latest items |

4. **Document auth requirements** — Note API keys, tokens, or open access.

**Output**: Present a structured API catalog to the user.

For the complete reconnaissance process, see [API-EXPLORER.md](references/API-EXPLORER.md).

## Phase 2: Data Shape Analysis

**Goal**: For each discovered endpoint, understand the response structure deeply enough to choose the right widget.

### Key Questions Per Endpoint

1. **What are the fields/columns?** List every field with its data type.
2. **How many records?** Typical result set size (affects widget choice).
3. **Is it filterable?** What query params narrow results?
4. **Is there a date dimension?** Time-series vs snapshot.
5. **Are there linkable URLs?** PDF links, external references, source documents.
6. **Is there rich text?** Markdown-compatible content, HTML, abstracts.
7. **Are there numeric aggregates?** Counts, sums, averages suitable for metrics.

### Example: Federal Register API

```
GET /documents.json
├── Data Shape: Tabular (array of document objects)
├── Key Fields: title, type, abstract, pdf_url, publication_date, agencies
├── Filterable By: conditions[term], conditions[agencies], conditions[type]
├── Date Dimension: publication_date (time-series possible)
├── Linkable URLs: pdf_url, html_url
├── Rich Text: abstract (narrative), body (HTML)
├── Numeric Aggregates: count (total results)
└── Pagination: page, per_page (max 1000)
```

**Output**: Annotated data shape analysis for each useful endpoint.

---

## Phase 3: Widget Mapping

**Goal**: Match each data shape to the OpenBB widget type that extracts maximum value.

### The Widget Decision Matrix

For the complete decision matrix and optimization strategies, see [WIDGET-OPTIMIZER.md](references/WIDGET-OPTIMIZER.md).

### Quick Mapping Rules

| Data Shape | Best Widget | Why | Alternative |
|------------|-------------|-----|-------------|
| Tabular (many rows) | `table` | Sort, filter, export, chart-convert | `live_grid` if real-time |
| Tabular (few rows) | `table` with `state.chartView` | Users see both data and chart | `chart` if visualization-first |
| Time Series | `chart` (Plotly line/bar) | Visual trends over time | `table` with chart state |
| Single Record | `markdown` | Formatted detail view | `table` (1-row) |
| Document/PDF | `pdf` | Native PDF viewing | `html` if HTML available |
| Narrative Text | `markdown` | Readable formatted text | `newsfeed` if article-like |
| Hierarchical | `table` with grouping | Collapse/expand categories | `markdown` (tree view) |
| Metric/Scalar | `metric` | KPI cards with deltas | `markdown` (formatted stats) |
| Feed/Stream | `newsfeed` | Title + date + excerpt + body | `table` (sortable feed) |
| Mixed Content | `omni` | AI-driven dynamic layout | Combine multiple widgets |

### PDF Widget — Getting Maximum Value

The `pdf` widget is powerful but often underused. Optimal patterns:

1. **Direct PDF URL**: Endpoint returns `{"url": "https://...pdf"}` — widget renders the PDF inline
2. **Dynamic PDF selection**: Use a `table` widget with document list + `pdf` widget in same group — clicking a row loads that document's PDF
3. **Parameter-driven**: Add params like `document_id` so users can navigate to specific documents

```json
{
  "doc_viewer": {
    "name": "Document Viewer",
    "type": "pdf",
    "endpoint": "document_pdf",
    "params": [
      {
        "paramName": "document_number",
        "type": "text",
        "label": "Document Number",
        "value": ""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The endpoint should return: `{"url": "https://example.com/document.pdf"}`

### Newsfeed Widget — Structured Content

Best for chronological content with title/date/body structure:

```python
@app.get("/feed")
def feed():
    return [
        {
            "title": "Document Title",
            "date": "2024-01-15",
            "author": "Agency Name",
            "excerpt": "First 200 chars of abstract...",
            "body": "Full abstract or content in **markdown**",
            "url": "https://link-to-source.gov"
        }
    ]
```

---

## Phase 4: Parameter Strategy — Ontology-Driven Design

**Goal**: Design params that respect how users **think about** the information — not just what the API technically accepts.

### The Core Principle

**DO NOT** just map API query params 1:1 to widget params. Instead:
1. Understand the **ontology** of the information (from Phase 0 interview)
2. Design params that let users **navigate** the data the way they naturally think about it
3. Build **layered specificity** — broad category → subcategory → specific item

### Anti-Pattern: The Lazy Single-ID Param

```json
// BAD — forces user to know the document ID
{
  "paramName": "document_id",
  "type": "text",
  "label": "Document ID"
}
```

This is the **worst possible UX**. The user has to go find an ID somewhere else before they can use the widget. Never do this unless there's truly no alternative.

### Correct Pattern: Ontology-Respecting Navigation

```json
// GOOD — lets user navigate by how they think about the data
[
  {
    "paramName": "agency",
    "type": "endpoint",
    "label": "Agency",
    "optionsEndpoint": "/agencies",
    "value": ""
  },
  {
    "paramName": "document_type",
    "type": "text",
    "label": "Type",
    "options": [
      {"label": "All Types", "value": ""},
      {"label": "Rules", "value": "RULE"},
      {"label": "Proposed Rules", "value": "PRORULE"},
      {"label": "Notices", "value": "NOTICE"},
      {"label": "Presidential Documents", "value": "PRESDOCU"}
    ],
    "value": ""
  },
  {
    "paramName": "date_start",
    "type": "date",
    "label": "From Date",
    "value": "$currentDate-1M"
  },
  {
    "paramName": "date_end",
    "type": "date",
    "label": "To Date",
    "value": "$currentDate"
  },
  {
    "paramName": "search_term",
    "type": "text",
    "label": "Search Keywords",
    "value": ""
  },
  {
    "paramName": "sort_by",
    "type": "text",
    "label": "Sort By",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Newest First", "value": "newest"},
      {"label": "Relevance", "value": "relevance"},
      {"label": "Oldest First", "value": "oldest"}
    ],
    "value": "newest"
  }
]
```

### Ontology Analysis Checklist

For every API, identify these navigational dimensions and expose them as params:

| Dimension | Question | Param Type |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Category/Type** | What are the main kinds of things? | `options` dropdown or `endpoint` |
| **Source/Origin** | Who produces this data? (agency, author, org) | `endpoint` (dynamic list) |
| **Time** | When was it created/published/effective? | `date` range (start + end) |
| **Geography** | Where does it apply? (country, state, region) | `options` or `endpoint` |
| **Status/State** | What stage is it in? (draft, final, archived) | `options` dropdown |
| **Topic/Subject** | What is it about? | `text` (free search) or `options` |
| **Relationship** | How does it connect to other entities? | `endpoint` with `optionsParams` |
| **Magnitude** | How much/many? (size, amount, count) | `number` range |

### Building Param Hierarchies

When dimensions are **nested** (e.g., agency → subagency → office), use dependent params:

```json
[
  {
    "paramName": "agency",
    "type": "endpoint",
    "label": "Agency",
    "optionsEndpoint": "/agencies"
  },
  {
    "paramName": "subagency",
    "type": "endpoint",
    "label": "Sub-Agency",
    "optionsEndpoint": "/subagencies",
    "optionsParams": {"agency": "$agency"}
  }
]
```

### Parameter Translation Rules (Reference)

| API Parameter | OpenBB Param Type | Strategy |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| Free-text search (`q`, `term`, `query`) | `text` | Direct mapping, good default empty |
| Category filter (finite set) | `text` with `options` | Fetch possible values, make dropdown |
| Category filter (large set) | `endpoint` | Dynamic dropdown from backend endpoint |
| Date range (`start_date`, `end_date`) | `date` | Use `$currentDate` modifiers for defaults |
| Numeric limit (`per_page`, `limit`) | `number` | Set sensible default (20-50) |
| Boolean flag (`include_x`, `only_y`) | `boolean` | Direct mapping |
| Sort order | `text` with `options` | Map API sort values to labels |
| ID/identifier | **AVOID** — prefer browsable navigation (see above) | Only as last resort with `endpoint` |

### Param Design Principles

1. **Never force the user to know an ID** — Always provide a way to browse/discover entities through dropdowns, search, or linked widgets. If an ID is needed internally, hide it behind a user-friendly selector.

2. **Mirror the ontology** — If the data is organized by agency → type → date in the real world, your params should follow that same structure.

3. **Layered specificity** — Start broad (category, date range) and let users drill down. Don't make them specify everything up front.

4. **Smart defaults that show data** — Never start with empty results. Set defaults that show useful data immediately:
   - Date: `$currentDate-1M` (last month)
   - Limit: 25 (not too few, not overwhelming)
   - Type/Category: "All" or most common type

5. **Don't expose plumbing** — Hide pagination, format flags, internal IDs. Handle them server-side.

6. **Dependent params** — Use `optionsParams` when one dimension depends on another.

7. **Group sync** — When multiple widgets share a context (e.g., search table + document viewer), use parameter groups so selecting in one widget updates others.

For complete parameter strategy patterns, see [WIDGET-OPTIMIZER.md](references/WIDGET-OPTIMIZER.md#parameter-strategy).

---

## Phase 5: Persona Fit

**Goal**: Tailor widget selection and layout to how the user actually works.

For detailed persona profiles and workflow mapping, see [PERSONA-MAPPER.md](references/PERSONA-MAPPER.md).

### Quick Persona Profiles

| Persona | Primary Widgets | Key Features | Layout Style |
|---------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Researcher** | `table` + `pdf` + `markdown` | Deep search, document viewing, notes | 2-tab: Search / Document |
| **Monitor** | `newsfeed` + `metric` + `table` | Latest updates, KPI tracking, alerts | Single dense dashboard |
| **Analyst** | `table` + `chart` + `metric` | Data exploration, trends, comparisons | Multi-tab with chart focus |
| **Executive** | `metric` + `chart` + `markdown` | High-level KPIs, summaries | Single tab, metrics on top |
| **Compliance** | `table` + `pdf` + `newsfeed` | Regulatory tracking, document review | 2-tab: Feed / Review |

---

## Phase 6: Possibilities Report

**Goal**: Present the user with concrete, actionable dashboard concepts they can hand off to the app-builder skill.

### Report Format

Present findings as a structured report:

```markdown
# API Discovery Report: {API Name}

## API Overview
- **Base URL**: {url}
- **Auth**: {none/key/token}
- **Rate Limits**: {if any}
- **Total Endpoints Explored**: {N}

## Data Available
{Table of endpoints with data shapes}

## Recommended Dashboards

### Dashboard Concept 1: "{Name}"
**Best for**: {persona}
**Widgets**:
| Widget | Type | Data Source | Key Params |
|--------|------|------------|------------|
| {name} | {type} | {endpoint} | {params} |

**Layout sketch**:
```
┌──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│  Search/Filter   │   Document PDF   │
│  (table)         │   (pdf)          │
│  w:20 h:15       │   w:20 h:15      │
├──────────────────┴──────────────────┤
│  Recent Activity (newsfeed) w:40    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**To build**: Tell the app-builder:
> "Build an OpenBB app called {name}. Use {API} with these widgets: {list}. I need {params}."
```

### Key Principles

1. **Show, don't tell** — Include ASCII layout sketches so users can visualize the dashboard
2. **Multiple concepts** — Offer 2-3 dashboard ideas for different use cases
3. **Actionable handoff** — Each concept includes the exact prompt to give the app-builder skill
4. **Be honest about limits** — Note any endpoints that won't work well (rate limits, auth issues, complex pagination)

---

## Combining with App Builder

This skill produces a **Discovery Report**. The user can then:

1. Pick a dashboard concept from the report
2. Use the provided prompt with the `openbb-app-builder` skill
3. The app-builder picks up exactly where discovery left off

The discovery report acts as a bridge — it does the thinking so the builder can do the making.

## Common API Patterns & How to Handle Them

### REST APIs with JSON (Most Common)
- Fetch docs, catalog endpoints, map directly to widgets
- Example: Federal Register, CoinGecko, SEC EDGAR

### GraphQL APIs
- Explore schema with introspection query
- Map queries to individual widget endpoints
- Backend acts as GraphQL→REST translator

### APIs Returning XML/HTML
- Backend parses and converts to JSON
- XML feeds → newsfeed widget
- HTML content → markdown widget (strip tags) or html widget

### APIs with PDF Downloads
- Backend provides PDF URL passthrough
- Pair with table widget for document browsing
- Use pdf widget for viewing

### APIs with Rate Limits
- Note limits in discovery report
- Recommend caching strategy (5-15 min)
- Suggest `runButton: true` for expensive endpoints
- Backend handles rate limit compliance

### APIs Requiring Pagination
- Backend aggregates pages transparently
- Expose `limit` param to user (not page number)
- Set reasonable default (25-50 items)
